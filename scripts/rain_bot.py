"""The second automated participant in a `rain` draw: it resolves, it claims,
it puts the prize back in.

`rain` is deliberately pull, not push (see `smart_contracts/rain/contract.py`):
`draw` only locks a prize and fixes a future beacon round, because that is all
a bare Arcron upkeep can do. Somebody still has to supply the beacon
(`resolve`) and the winner still has to pull their own prize (`claim`). On a
draw with only one real participant, "somebody" and "the winner" are the same
account, so this bot holds that account, watches one `rain` app, and does
three things, in order, every time it runs:

  1. If a draw is open and the beacon round has passed, call `resolve`,
     supplying the beacon app reference a scheduled call could not attach.
  2. If a draw's beacon window has closed unresolved, call `abandon` so the
     prize returns to the pot instead of sitting locked forever.
  3. If this account has anything allocated (`allocation_of`), `claim` it,
     then `deposit` the exact amount claimed straight back into the pot.
     `claim` and `deposit` are two transactions, not one atomic group, so
     what was claimed is recorded to a small local state file first (see
     `default_pending_path`) and only cleared once the deposit confirms;
     that way a crash between the two redeposits on the next run instead of
     stranding a won prize in this account's own wallet forever.

Step 3 is what "circulates" means here, concretely. The pot after a full
cycle is the pot before it: `draw` reserves the box MBR the winner's
allocation needs, `claim` releases it back to the pot when the box is
deleted, and this bot re-deposits the rest. **What does not circulate is
transaction fees.** `resolve`, `claim` and `deposit` are three signed
transactions this account pays for out of its own balance, on top of the
Arcron keeper fee `draw` itself pays out of the upkeep's escrow. Measured at
the registered cadence (arcron's `docs/releases.md` has the number), that is real
ALGO leaving the system every cycle, forever. It is the cost of running the
dogfood, not a bug, and nothing about this design amortises it away.

This bot never opens a draw itself; that is Arcron's job; a keeper executing
the registered upkeep calls `draw` on its own schedule. This bot only reacts
to a draw that already exists, which is why every action here is a no-op
check before it is a transaction: run it as often as you like, including
from a cron job that overlaps with itself, and a quiet round costs nothing.

Picks its network with --network (or ARCRON_NETWORK), loading .env.localnet
or .env.testnet. Signs as the account from RAIN_MNEMONIC if set, else
DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC; resolving costs a small fee, and only a won prize is ever
paid out, straight back to this same account. On LocalNet both come from
KMD, so no mnemonic is needed.

Run:  poetry run python -m scripts.rain_bot --once [--network N] [--app-id N]

    one gap: `claim` and `deposit` are two separate transactions, not one

    a real run, see arcron's `docs/releases.md`) would otherwise strand a won prize

"""Prove a ONE draw can pick somebody who is not the caller, on a real chain.

`resolve` reads the committed round's block seed, takes it modulo the live
ticket count, and credits whoever that index points at. Every test of that is
either a mock with a planted seed (`tests/test_rain.py`) or a live run with a
single ticket (`scripts/rain_testnet_live_proof.py`), and `seed % 1` is zero
for every seed there has ever been. So on a real chain the draw has fired and
has never once *chosen*:

  * the index box at any offset but zero has never been read,
  * the winner's ticket box has never been a box the caller does not own,
    which is the one the resolving transaction has to reference without
    knowing the winner until it reads the seed,
  * and the modulo has never been exercised against a seed nobody planted.

This enters a ONE rain from several accounts and resolves until an index other
than zero comes up, checking every draw against the seed independently: the
expected index is recomputed here from `algod.block_info`, so a contract that
agreed with itself but not with the chain would fail rather than pass quietly.

Costs real TestNet ALGO. Players are funded from the deployer and closed back
to it at the end, but each ticket's box minimum stays in the hub permanently:
there is no `leave`.

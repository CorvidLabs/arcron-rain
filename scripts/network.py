# permanently, with no way back.
#
# A single account, `corvid.algo`, decided 2026-08-29. This replaces the 2-of-3
# from issue #79, and the reason is not convenience.
#
# Wallets do not sign for multisig. Tested on TestNet against a real member
# account, asked directly through Pera's own SDK with `msig` metadata and with
# use-wallet's filter bypassed, Pera answers "multisig signing is not
# supported". ARC-1 defines that field, use-wallet exports the type and
# implements none of it, and Pera's SDK declares it and refuses it. So a 2-of-3
# means every governance action is a mnemonic pasted into a shell by three
# people, including one whose key lives on a hardware device precisely so that
# never has to happen.
#
# The trade, stated rather than assumed. A single key can replace the programs
# governing every upkeep's escrow while `frozen == 0`. That is a real loss, and
# arcron's `docs/deploying.md` said a single mnemonic on a single machine is
# the wrong home for such a key. What makes it defensible is that `freeze` is one way and
# retires the key permanently: a single-key deployment frozen early is a smaller
# exposure than a 2-of-3 left upgradeable because signing is too painful to
# actually do. The commitment that goes with this decision is to freeze
# promptly, and the console discloses upgradeable status on every page until
# then.
#
# arcron keeps `scripts/multisig.py`; it did not come across in the split, and
# nothing here needs it while MainNet is refused outright. If a wallet ever
# ships multisig signing, this is one constant and one copied module away from
# going back.

    once turns `--network mainnet` back into an ordinary argument. The flag
    stops a typo; it does nothing about the thing that actually matters, which
    is which account signs.

    This used to require a multisig. It now requires the *right account*, which
    is the part that was ever load-bearing: a MainNet app's creator is fixed at
    creation, so deploying from the wrong key is unfixable whether that key is
    one account or three. Whether the creator is a multisig is a separate
    decision, recorded above `MAINNET_CREATOR`.

    A multisig still satisfies this, so nothing has to change if one is ever
    configured again: `scripts/multisig.py` derives an address like any other,
    and if it equals `MAINNET_CREATOR` this passes. That module stayed in the
    arcron repository and does not exist here, so its absence has to read as
    "no signer configured" and fall through to the refusal below — importing it
    unguarded would replace a deliberate refusal with an ImportError, which is
    the same outcome for the wrong reason and unreadable to whoever hits it.

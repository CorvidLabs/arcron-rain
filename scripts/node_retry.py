"""Surviving a public node that refuses to answer.

Ported verbatim from CorvidLabs/arcron on 2026-09-01, where it was written,
because this repository talks to the same `testnet-api.algonode.cloud` and hit
the same wall: `scripts/rain_testnet_deploy.py` died on `HTTP Error 403:
Forbidden` while trying to top up the upkeep that drives the live hub, which
is how the gap was noticed. Keep the two copies in step; the measurements
below were taken against arcron's keeper daemon and are the reason the policy
is what it is.


`fledge run health` died on two of three consecutive runs on 2026-09-01 with
`algosdk.error.AlgodHTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden`, thrown before the
report reached any of its own logic. Both obvious readings were wrong: the
node was not down, and we were not sending too fast. A hand-typed `curl` for
the same box listing succeeded, and so did 41 of 45 consecutive `/v2/status`
calls sent as fast as a shell could send them.

What the endpoint actually says, in headers and a body the SDK throws away:

    x-and-quota: block=1;reqs=230824;bytes=154489173;ts=2026-09-01
    Daily free API quota exceeded. / 230824 requests / 0.15 GB

The measurement that makes retrying the right answer rather than a hopeful
one: once `block=1` is set the edge does not refuse everything, it sheds a
fraction. Measured against a single edge (`x-and-nl: us4@us_losangeles`) whose
quota counter did not move during the sample, so which request gets shed is
the only variable: 4 refusals in 45 requests, about 9%. One request is very
likely to succeed, and a run of 40 is very likely to contain a failure —
1 - 0.91**40 is 98%, which is exactly why two runs in three died while a
one-off `curl` never did.

So this is not waiting for a window to reopen. It is asking to be sampled
again. `MAX_ATTEMPTS` is 5, so four retries follow the first try, and the odds
of all five being shed are 0.09**5: about 1 in 169,000.


Whose quota this is
-------------------

An earlier version of this docstring called the counter above "Nodely's
free-tier allowance for the endpoint as a whole, shared by everyone using it",
and concluded that "there is nothing here to fix by sending fewer". That was
asserted rather than established, and measuring it turned it around.

This repository's own keeper runs on the machine that ran the report, as the
launchd agent `scripts/keeper_daemon.py` installs
(`xyz.corvidlabs.arcron.keeper.testnet`), and `.env.testnet` points it at the
same `testnet-api.algonode.cloud` from the same address. Counted out of its own
log at `~/Library/Logs/arcron/keeper-testnet.log`: 11,543 `scan` events across
63,013 rounds, so a 2.70 s round and a scan every 5.46 of them. One scan of the
live 33-upkeep registry is 36 requests — `status`, the box listing, 33 box
reads, and the `status_after_block` long poll. `account_info` is not among
them: it runs on the heartbeat, one scan in `HEARTBEAT_SCANS` = 20, which an
earlier count here folded into every scan. That is 416,125 requests in 1.97
days, or **about 211,000 a day from this one bot**.
The counter that was blocked stood at 230,824. Both of those are measured, and
they are the same number to within 9%: one keeper of ours accounts for
substantially all of the traffic the endpoint refused us over.

And that is the figure the refusals have already throttled us down to. 96%
of those scans are 2 to 4 rounds apart, a mean of 2.48 rounds or 6.70 s, which
unrefused is 5.53 requests a second, or 477,403 a day. The 1,964 `scan_failed`
403s in the same log, each followed by a doubling sleep, are the only reason
the number is as low as it is. (200,000 a day is what this file has always
cited for the free tier. It is the one figure here nobody has checked against
Nodely, so the argument above is built on the counter instead, which we read
off our own responses.)

Nor is the counter the world's. Sampled twice 45 seconds apart on 2026-09-01,
`reqs` went 233,586 to 233,636 — 50 requests in 45.4 s, about one a second. An
allowance shared by everyone using a public Algorand endpoint would not climb
at one request a second.

What stays open is what the bucket is keyed to: our address, the absent token,
something else. Nobody here has read Nodely's side of it. The direction is not
open, and it is the opposite of what this file used to say. Sending fewer is
exactly the fix, and it is `scripts/keeper_bot.py` that owns it rather than
this module: a scan re-reads all 33 boxes every 2.5 rounds to notice that a
handful are due. Retrying keeps a report alive in the meantime; it is not a
reason the traffic is fine.


What is retried
---------------

Two statuses are retried whatever was asked:

    429  the per-second or concurrency limit, per Nodely's published policy
    403  the daily request or byte quota, which is what we hit

Both are refused by the CDN in front of the node rather than by algod. That is
why the body never reaches the exception: it is a plain sentence rather than
algod's JSON, so algosdk's `json.loads` fails, the message falls back to the
bare `HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` in the traceback above, and the status code
is the only thing left to match on.

5xx is retried for reads only. A 502 or 503 from the edge kills a `health` run
exactly as a 403 does, and asking a GET again cannot change anything whatever
produced the error, so refusing to ask bought nothing. A POST is a different
matter — not because replaying one is unsafe, since the argument below holds
for any status, but because a 5xx says the node behind the edge is in trouble
rather than the edge shedding, and the recovery below needs algod well enough
to answer "already in ledger". We have measured nothing about that: 47 hours of
keeper log hold 2,067 refusals and every one is a 403. Until there is something
to measure, the one call that spends money hands a 5xx to its caller, which for
a keeper costs a round rather than a fee.


Why replaying a POST is safe
----------------------------

The first version of this argued that the `x-and-quota` header and the
plain-text body prove the request never reached the node, so there was nothing
to submit twice. They prove no such thing. They prove the *response* was
written at the edge, which says nothing about whether the edge had already
forwarded the request, and a safety argument that rests on where a refusal was
generated is an argument we cannot check.

The real reason is better and does not depend on that. The only POST any of
this makes is `send_raw_transaction`, which sends an already-signed blob, and
an Algorand transaction id is a hash of that blob. `retrying` replays the same
bytes rather than re-signing, so a replay carries the same id, and a chain that
has already seen that id answers "already in ledger" instead of paying
anything a second time. Nor could a replay collide with somebody else's work:
the id hashes a signature only our key can produce.

Which leaves the case the old argument never had to face. If the *first* copy
landed, the replay comes back as a 400 in algod's own words, and a caller
reading that as a failure would be wrong in a specific and expensive-sounding
way. `keeper_bot` would ask the registry whether it had moved on, find that it
had — we moved it — and emit `race_lost`, reporting a keeper as having lost a
race against itself. Nothing is lost but the truth; the fee was paid once and
collected once. So the duplicate is not passed on. When, and only when, this
wrapper is the thing that replayed the request, the duplicate is recognised and
answered with the id algod would have returned, derived from the blob we sent
by the same hash the paragraph above rests on. The caller then waits on its own
transaction and watches it confirm, which is what actually happened.

Nodely's policy says failed requests still count towards the quota, so
retrying does add to a number this repository is itself blowing. Four extra
requests against 219,564 a day is not the part worth arguing about; the scan
rate is.

Installed once, on the clients `network.connect` hands out, so every script
that talks to a public node gets it without anyone remembering to ask.

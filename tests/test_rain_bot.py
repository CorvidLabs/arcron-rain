"""Unit tests for the rain bot's decision logic and allocation reader.

These do not touch a chain: `should_resolve`/`should_abandon` are pure
functions over decoded global state, and `read_allocation` is exercised
against a fake algod client that raises the same "box not found" shape a
real one does for a missing box. The live end-to-end proof (a real draw,
resolved against the real Foundation beacon) is `scripts.rain_testnet_deploy
--bootstrap-draw`, recorded in arcron's `docs/releases.md`.

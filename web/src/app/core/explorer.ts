/**
 * Links out to a block explorer.
 *
 * `NETWORKS.testnet.explorerApp` has existed since the console was written and
 * nothing ever called it, so nothing in the console linked to an explorer at
 * all: app ids, target apps, app accounts and transaction ids were plain text.
 * That matters most exactly where money is committed, because checking an app
 * id somewhere we do not control is the one verification a visitor can make
 * that this page cannot fake.
 *
 * LocalNet has no explorer, so every one of these returns null there and the
 * caller renders text instead. A dead link to a chain nobody outside the
 * machine can reach would be worse than no link.

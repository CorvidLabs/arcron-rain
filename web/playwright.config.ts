/**
 * The rendering suite: build the page, serve it, and look at it.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose. `webServer` builds the production bundle and
 * serves it with the single-page fallback, so the suite runs from a cold
 * checkout with nothing else started - no `ng serve`, no LocalNet, no TestNet,
 * no network at all. The chain it reads is stubbed at the HTTP boundary in
 * `e2e/chain.ts`, which is what makes a round number stop being a source of
 * failure.
 *
 * Chromium only, deliberately. This suite is not asking whether the page works
 * in three engines; it is asking what the CSS resolves to and where the boxes
 * land, and one engine answers that in a third of the time. Cross-engine
 * behaviour is a different suite with a different reason to exist.

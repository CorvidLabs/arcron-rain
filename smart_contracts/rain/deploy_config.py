    Deliberately not `factory.deploy()`'s idempotent find-or-create, which
    arcron's own deploy configs use: that path looks up existing apps
    by creator and name through the indexer, and the public TestNet indexer
    is a shared, quota-limited resource that this project has already hit
    empty (see the rain deployment note in arcron's `docs/releases.md`). A plain `create`
    needs no indexer at all, and re-running against a known `app_id` needs
    none either.

    This only creates the app. The hub's own floor is collected by
    `bootstrap`, and each rain's box MBR by `create_rain`. Neither is called
    here: the caller knows the keeper and the first rain, and this function
    does not.
